# Random-Quote-Generator

This is an Random Quote Generator application which is build using ReactJs which will display some random quotes when clicked upon a button. To get random quotes an API has been used and a http request has been made to API using axios library which will send the response in the form of a JSON object. In this, useState Hook is used to change the state of a component and useEffect Hook is used to call the API. I have also implemented the feature to tweet the quotes on twitter.
